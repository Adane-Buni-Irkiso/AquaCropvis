# AquaCropvis

Understanding the detailed outputs of AquaCrop model is crucial for agricultural water management. However, the raw numerical data generated by this model can be challenging to interpret and gain insights from directly. This Python code enables quick visualization of the AquaCrop model timeseries outputs, specifically focusing on the temporal dynamics of key variables such as Evapotranspiration, soil moisture content over the crop growth cycle (represented by Days After Planting - DAP). Additionally, this script facilitates a clear and intuitive comparisons, making it significantly easier to discern trends, identify critical periods of water use, and ultimately enhance our understanding of the complex interactions simulated by AquaCrop.
