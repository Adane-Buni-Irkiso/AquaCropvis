# AquaCropvis

Understanding the detailed outputs of AquaCrop model is crucial for agricultural water management. However, the raw numerical data generated by this model can be challenging to instantly or directly interpret. AquaCropvis contains Python codes that enable quick visualization of the AquaCrop model outputs, specifically focusing on the temporal dynamics and comparisons of key variables, making it significantly easier to discern trends, identify critical periods of water use, and ultimately enhance our understanding of the complex interactions simulated by AquaCrop.

# Saving AquaCrop Outputs on your device

It is presumed that the user already did simulation runs in the standard AquaCrop model. The AquaCrop outputs should be saved in the same manner as displayed below.
